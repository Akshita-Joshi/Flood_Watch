FloodWatch: Mobile apps to give flood alerts 8-10 hours prior to the floods.

***SIH 2022 Winner project***

This repository has 1 app which is for the citizens. Once, a citizen registers using their mobile number, he/she will have to provide access for location as well as hometown address as that is essential for flood alerts.
Flood alerts are given to people in high alert areas(red zones) and in areas where there is possibility of flooding(yellow zones) based on their location and/or hometown address to relocate.
Flood alerts are given in the form of notifications via app as well as SMS to the registered mobile number. Suppose a person doesn't have a mobile phone with GPS then SMS facility is provided based on their hometown address.

Further, alerts are given to NDRF(National Disaster Response Force) team to relocate the citizens. These notifications will be sent every 10 mins until an acknowledgement is received from NDRF. Clusters of nearby towns along with population is shown for their ease to rescue citizens.

Dam Manager is the one who inputs 3 values- Water discharge value, depth and velocity of water. Based on these values the model computes if these values surpass the threshold value and only then alerts are given out. Threshold value for every dam is different and we get this value for HEC-RAS -  A river modelling software. The dam manager has a website where he can input these values.
